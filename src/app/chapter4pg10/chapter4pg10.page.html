  <h3>God Is Love</h3>
  <p>
    7 Those who are loved by God, let his love continually pour from
    you to one another, because God is love. Everyone who loves is fathered by
    God and experiences an intimate knowledge of him. 8 The one who doesn’t love
    has yet to know God, for God is love. 9 The light of God’s love shined
    within us when he sent his matchless Son into the world so that we
    might live through him. 10 This is love: He loved us long before we
    loved him. It was his love, not ours. He proved it by sending his Son to be
    the pleasing sacrificial offering to take away our sins. 11 Delightfully
    loved ones, if he loved us with such tremendous love, then “loving one
    another” should be our way of life! 12 No one has ever gazed upon the
    fullness of God’s splendor. But if we love one another, God makes his
    permanent home in us, and we make our permanent home in him, and his love is
    brought to its full expression in us. 13 And he has given us his Spirit
    within us so that we can have the assurance that he lives in us and that we
    live in him. 14 Moreover, we have seen with our own eyes and can testify to
    the truth that Father God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15
    Those who give thanks that Jesus is the Son of God live in God, and God
    lives in them. 16 We have come into an intimate experience with God’s love,
    and we trust in the love he has for us. God is love! Those who are
    living in love are living in God, and God lives through them. 17 By living
    in God, love has been brought to its full expression in us so that we
    may fearlessly face the day of judgment, because all that Jesus now
    is, so are we in this world. 18 Love never brings fear, for fear is
    always related to punishment. But love’s perfection drives the fear of
    punishment far from our hearts. Whoever walks constantly afraid of
    punishment has not reached love’s perfection. 19 Our love for others is
    our grateful response to the love God first demonstrated to us. 20 Anyone
    can say, “I love God,” yet have hatred toward another believer. This makes
    him a phony, because if you don’t love a brother or sister, whom you can
    see, how can you truly love God, whom you can’t see? 21 For he has given us
    this command: whoever loves God must also demonstrate love to others.
