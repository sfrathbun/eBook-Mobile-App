  <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
  <h3>The Proof of Love and the Victory of Faith</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah is God’s spiritual child
    and has been fathered by God himself. And everyone who loves Father God
    loves his children as well. 2 This is how we can be sure that we love the
    children of God: by having a passionate love for God and by obedience to his
    commands. 3 True love for God means obeying his commands, and his commands
    don’t weigh us down as heavy burdens. 4 You see, every child of God
    overcomes the world, for our faith is the victorious power that triumphs
    over the world. 5 So who are the world conquerors, defeating its power?
    Those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.

  <h3>The Spirit, the Water, and the Blood</h3>
  <p>
    6 Jesus Christ is the One who was revealed as God’s Son by his water baptism
    and by the blood of his cross not by water only, but by water and blood.
    And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms this with his testimony. 7 So we have
    these three constant witnesses giving their evidence: 8 the Spirit, the
    water, and the blood. And these three are in agreement. 9 If we accept the
    testimony of men, how much more should we accept the more authoritative
    testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son? 10 Those who
    believe in the Son of God have the living testimony in their hearts. Those
    who don’t believe have made God out to be a liar by not believing the
    testimony God has confirmed about his Son. 11 This is the true testimony:
    that God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his
    Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has eternal life; whoever does not have the
    Son does not possess eternal life.
